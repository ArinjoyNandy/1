# Crack particle count (provided photo)

Estimated particle count from the provided specimen image: **~80 particles**.

Because the image has glare and some crack lines are faint/merged, practical counting
is best reported as a range: **75–85 particles**.

`count_particles.py` is included to automate counting on local images with OpenCV and
to generate a labeled overlay for review.
